# WHO_NI_Tutorial

This tutorial provides guidance on making non-inferiority assessments from experimental hut trial (EHT) data. Code is provided in both R and STATA. You should begin by downloading the files, unzipping the folder, and moving the folder to your desired location on your computer. To use the R code, you should first download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com). We recommend opening the R Project file 'WHO_NI_tutorial.RProj' first: this means that your R session should begin with the working directory set to the folder containing the relevant files.
